- [Do Deep Nets Really Need to be Deep?](http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6184) "Once a deep network is trained, a shallow network can learn the same function from the outputs of the deep network. The shallow network can't learn the same function directly from the data. This indicates that deep learning could be an optimization/learning trick".
